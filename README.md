# MCA-Scores
Score collection of the Madrigal Choir Aachen

This repository is meant for setting music in lilypond which cannnot be obtained in a readable form anywhere else.
The music scoring program is lilypond (www.lilypond.org). Scores are ordered by composer and piece. Each folder holds the lilypond sourcefile necessary for creating pdf-files from it. Short examples can be found in ```./templates```. A documentation of lilypond is given here: http://lilypond.org/manuals.html
A tutorial on using lilypond is coming up ...

## Folder Structure
The folder structure is as follows:
Source files are ordered by ```<composer>/<opus>/<lilypond_source(s)>``` Compiled pdfs are placed inside ```Noten_PDFs_fertig/<composer>/<opus>/*.pdf``` after revision. Compiled MIDI files go into ```Noten_MIDIs_fertig/<composer>/<opus>/*.pdf```.
Ths duplicates should be avoided.
