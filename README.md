# MCA-Scores
Score collection of the Madrigal Choir Aachen

This repository is meant for setting music in lilypond which cannnot be obtained in a readable form anywhere else.
The music scoring program is lilypond (www.lilypond.org). Scores are ordered by composer and piece. Each folder holds the lilypond sourcefile necessary for creating pdf-files from it. Short examples can be found in ```./templates```. A documentation of lilypond is given here: http://lilypond.org/manuals.html
A tutorial on using lilypond is coming up ...
